**My first commercial project**
This is my first commercial project in which I used my previous knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. In addition, I created the entire mockup for the client's website.

## üí≠ What I learned

Thanks to this project, I learned how to prepare the project fully for the production version. I learned how to handle hosting, domain and consolidated the technologies I learned. Also, direct contact with the client drew my attention to his needs and allowed me to propose some solutions that can help him promote himself on the Internet.
